# UC Salary Analysis Repository

## Overview  
This repository contains structured and analyzed salary data for the University of California (UC) system, based on publicly available records from Transparent California. It offers a fully reproducible pipeline for data collection, cleaning, categorization, analysis, and visualization of compensation data across UC system. The goal of this project is to promote transparency, equity, and accountability by making it easier to explore trends in university pay structuresâ€”including disparities across job titles, campuses, and employment categories (e.g., faculty, administration, student workers, and physical labor roles). The repository supports both exploratory analysis and more formal reporting using well-documented code and reproducible workflows.


## Installation
